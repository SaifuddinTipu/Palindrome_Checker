# Palindrome_Checker
The source code of this project shows how to check a Palindrome from a string typed by the user. When user input a string, it will check whether the input is a string or not. If the input contains any white space, numeric or alpha-numeric character, the program will remove those characters and will keep the string only to check.This source code is in C++.
